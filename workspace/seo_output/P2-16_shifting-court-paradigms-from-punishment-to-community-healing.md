### Legal Framework and Regulatory Context

The **court paradigm shift punishment to community healing** is grounded in a growing body of research and legislation that supports the use of **restorative sentencing** and **community-based justice** initiatives. The Justice for All Act of 2004, for example, emphasizes the importance of victim restitution and community service as alternatives to traditional punishment.

The **community healing approach criminal justice** is also informed by international human rights standards, such as the United Nations' Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which emphasize the importance of rehabilitation and restorative justice. As US courts continue to evolve, they are drawing on these international frameworks to inform their approach to justice and rehabilitation. By adopting a more **modern court reform community-based justice** approach, courts can better address the complex needs of offenders, victims, and communities, leading to more sustainable and effective justice outcomes.

The current standards for justice and rehabilitation in the US are undergoing significant transformation, driven by the recognition that traditional punitive approaches often fail to address the root causes of crime. **Courts moving from punishment to rehabilitation** are increasingly adopting evidence-based practices that prioritize offender rehabilitation, restorative justice, and community healing.
