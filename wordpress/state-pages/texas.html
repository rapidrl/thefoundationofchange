<h2>Online Community Service in Texas — What You Need to Know</h2>
<p>Texas residents who need to complete community service hours — whether for court requirements, probation conditions, school graduation, or personal development — can fulfill their obligations entirely online through The Foundation of Change. Our 501(c)(3) nonprofit program provides a structured, self-paced educational experience accepted by courts and probation departments throughout Texas.</p>

<h3>Texas Court System and Community Service</h3>
<p>Texas's court system includes District Courts, County Courts, and Justice of the Peace Courts across 254 counties — the most of any state. Courts in <strong>Houston</strong>, <strong>Dallas</strong>, <strong>San Antonio</strong>, and <strong>Fort Worth</strong> regularly assign community service as part of sentencing for misdemeanor offenses, DUI cases, and first-time offender programs. Our certificate provides the verified documentation Texas courts require.</p>

<h3>Why Texas Residents Choose Online Community Service</h3>
<p>Texas has more counties than any other state — 254 — each with its own court system. Harris County (Houston) alone has one of the largest court systems in the world. From the sprawling DFW metroplex to remote West Texas communities hundreds of miles from the nearest city, our online program provides Texas residents with unmatched flexibility. Texas courts frequently use community service in deferred adjudication agreements.</p>

<h3>Verification and Acceptance</h3>
<p>Every certificate includes a unique verification code that Texas courts and probation officers can independently verify through our online portal. We provide detailed hour logs showing dates, times, and hours completed. Our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status provides the legitimacy Texas courts expect from community service providers.</p>
