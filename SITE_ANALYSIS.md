## 5. Migration Plan — Vercel + Supabase

### Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| **Auth** | Supabase Auth |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage (PDFs, certificates) |
| **Payments** | Stripe (replaces Wix payments) |
| **Email** | Resend or Supabase Edge Functions + SMTP |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules or Tailwind (TBD with client) |

### ⚠️ Design Note: Google Stitch Redesign In Progress
The client is actively working on a **UI redesign in Google Stitch**. This means:
- **The visual design is NOT final** — expect new layouts, components, and styles to arrive
- Stitch can export design tokens, CSS, and component structures
- **Our architecture must separate content/logic from presentation** so we can swap UI without touching business logic

**Architecture decisions to support this:**
1. **Component-based structure** — small, reusable UI components in `/components/ui/` that can be replaced wholesale
2. **Design tokens** — colors, typography, spacing in a central `tokens.css` or theme file, easy to overwrite with Stitch exports
3. **Content in data layer** — page content (FAQ items, program descriptions, etc.) stored in Supabase or JSON files, not hardcoded in JSX
4. **Layout vs. content separation** — layouts in `layout.tsx`, page content in `page.tsx`, UI primitives in `components/`
5. **CSS Modules preferred** — scoped styles per component, easy to replace one at a time without side effects

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Static Pages 🏗️
**Goal**: Recreate the public-facing site with identical content, improved design

**Tasks**:
1. Initialize Next.js project, deploy to Vercel
2. Set up shared layout (header, footer, navigation)
3. Build static pages:
   - `/` — Home (hero, transparency, certificate preview, CTAs)
   - `/about-us` — About Us
   - `/community` — Community Service Program (with state list)
   - `/faq` — FAQ (accordion component)
   - `/how-it-works` — How It Works
   - `/how-to-register` — Registration walkthrough
   - `/our-guarantee` — Program breakdown & pricing
   - `/additional-services` — Partner services
   - `/letter-of-introductions` — PDF download links
   - `/contact-us` — Contact form (basic, sends email)
4. Legal pages: `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, `/refund-policy`
5. SEO: meta tags, OG images, structured data (NonprofitOrganization schema)
6. Responsive design (mobile-first)

**Deliverable**: Fully deployed static site on Vercel, visual parity with Wix

   - `reflections` (article_id, user_id, response_text, submitted_at, status)
   - `time_logs` (user_id, enrollment_id, date, seconds_tracked, articles_completed)
2. Build coursework page (`/coursework`)
   - Article reader with progress tracking
   - Built-in timer (pauses on inactivity — idle detection)
   - Reflection submission forms after articles
   - 8-hour daily cap enforcement
   - Auto-save progress
3. Admin review interface for reflections (stretch)

**Deliverable**: Participants can read articles, submit reflections, track time

### Phase 6: Admin Dashboard 🛠️
**Goal**: Centralized admin panel where the client can manage all users and operations from one place

> **Client requirement (2026-02-21)**: "I just wanted an admin dashboard that I could see all information about my users in 1 place where I could add or change their time from there I can see all their information I can see how much they paid"

**Tasks**:
1. Admin dashboard (`/admin`) — protected, role-based access
2. **User Management** (`/admin/users`)
   - Searchable/filterable table of ALL participants
   - Each row shows: name, email, phone, enrollment status, hours completed/required, amount paid, registration date
   - Click to open **user detail view** with full profile
3. **User Detail View** (`/admin/users/[id]`)
   - Full profile info (name, email, phone, address, probation officer, court ID)
   - Enrollment history with payment amounts + Stripe IDs
   - **Edit hours**: admin can manually add, subtract, or override completed hours
   - **Edit time logs**: view and modify daily hour entries
   - Certificate status + download links
   - Reflection submissions + review controls
   - Activity timeline (registration, payments, completions)
4. **Enrollment Management** (`/admin/enrollments`)
   - All enrollments, filter by status (active/completed/suspended)
   - Bulk actions (suspend, complete, export CSV)
5. **Payment Overview** (`/admin/payments`)
   - All payments with Stripe links
   - Revenue totals (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Filter by date range, amount, status
6. **Reflection Review** (`/admin/reflections`)
   - Queue of pending reflections to approve/flag
   - Linked to user profile
7. **Contact Submissions** (`/admin/messages`)
   - Inbox of contact form submissions
   - Mark as replied/closed
8. **Dashboard Home** (`/admin`)
   - Overview stats: total users, active enrollments, revenue this month, pending reflections
   - Recent activity feed
   - Quick-action shortcuts

**Admin Access Control**:
- Admin role stored in `profiles.role` column
- Middleware check: only `role = 'admin'` can access `/admin/*` routes
- RLS policies allow admins to read/write all tables

**Deliverable**: Full admin panel where client can see all user data, edit hours, view payments, and manage operations from one place

## 6. Supabase Database Schema (Draft)

```sql
-- Users handled by Supabase Auth (auth.users)

-- Extended profile
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  state TEXT,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'participant', -- 'participant' | 'admin'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Program enrollments
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  hours_required INTEGER NOT NULL,
  hours_completed NUMERIC(6,2) DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active', -- 'active' | 'completed' | 'suspended'
  stripe_payment_id TEXT,
  amount_paid NUMERIC(8,2),
  enrolled_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Course content
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE articles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  estimated_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Participant reflections
CREATE TABLE reflections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id),
  article_id UUID REFERENCES articles(id),
  response_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending' | 'approved' | 'flagged'
  reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Time tracking
CREATE TABLE time_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id),
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  seconds_tracked INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  articles_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Certificates
CREATE TABLE certificates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  verification_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  hours_verified NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL,
  pdf_url TEXT,
  hour_log_pdf_url TEXT,
  issued_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Contact form submissions
CREATE TABLE contact_submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new', -- 'new' | 'replied' | 'closed'
  submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

## 7. Priority Order & Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1** — get the static site live fast to prove the new platform
2. **Phase 2+3 together** — auth and payments are tightly coupled (no account without enrollment)
3. **Phase 4 is the big one** — the LMS/time-tracking is the core product and most complex
4. **Phase 5 follows naturally** — certificates depend on completed coursework
5. **Phase 6 can be minimal** — start with a simple admin view, iterate based on client needs
6. **Phase 7 is ongoing** — launch can happen after Phase 5, with Phase 6 following

### Key Risks
- **Course content migration** — need to extract 100+ articles from Wix (manual or API export)
- **Time tracking accuracy** — needs robust idle detection; this is the core compliance feature
- **Certificate trust** — verification portal must be reliable (99.9% uptime target per their docs)
- **Existing user data** — may need to migrate users/enrollments from Wix

### Quick Wins
- Modern, faster site (Wix is heavy)
- Better SEO (Next.js SSR/SSG)
- Custom certificate verification portal (not limited by Wix)
- Full control over the LMS experience
- Lower ongoing costs (no Wix subscription)
