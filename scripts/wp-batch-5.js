Transportation challenges in Appalachian communities make in-person community service particularly difficult. Our online program provides West Virginia residents with reliable access to verified community service regardless of their location.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Verification and Acceptance</h3>\r\n<p>Every certificate includes a unique verification code that West Virginia courts and probation officers can independently verify through our online portal.
